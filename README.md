# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Google Play Store Dataset

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Play Store Dataset** project repository! In this project, we will perform an in-depth exploration of the Google Play Store dataset to answer specific questions about app categories, ratings, installs, sizes, and more.

## Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a powerful technique that allows us to gain insights and understanding from a dataset. In this project, we will leverage EDA to answer key questions about the Google Play Store data and uncover valuable insights.

## Dataset

The dataset we'll be working with is the Google Play Store dataset, which provides information about various mobile apps available on the platform. The dataset includes details such as app names, categories, ratings, installs, sizes, prices, and more.

You can obtain the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps). Make sure to download the CSV file named `Google-Playstore.csv`.

## Analysis Steps and Questions Answered

During this EDA project, we will answer the following questions:

1. **Top 10 Installed Categories**: Identify the top 10 app categories with the highest number of installs.
2. **Most Installed Categories**: Determine the categories that receive the highest number of installations among the top 10 categories.
3. **Highest Rated Category**: Find the category with the highest average app rating.
4. **Highest Paid and Free Apps Category**: Identify the category with the highest count of paid and free apps.
5. **Impact of Application Size on Installation**: Analyze how the size of an app impacts its installation count.
6. **Top 5 Paid Apps with High Ratings and Installs**: List the top 5 paid apps with the highest ratings and installs.
7. **Top 5 Free Apps with High Ratings and Installs**: List the top 5 free apps with the highest ratings and installs.

## Project Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Directory housing the Jupyter notebook (`EDA_Google_Play_Store.ipynb`) where data loading, cleaning, exploration, and analyses take place.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading, providing a project overview, dataset details, analysis questions, and project structure.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`EDA_Google_Play_Store.ipynb`) to begin the exploratory data analysis.

Feel free to customize the code, conduct additional analyses, and gain valuable insights from the Google Play Store dataset. Happy analyzing! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“±
